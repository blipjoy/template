# Blipjoy Template

A template to ease creating new games using melonJS.

## About

I hate starting from scratch when building a brand new game! I hate it so much
that it causes me to procrastinate when starting a new project. This template is
an attempt to lower the entry barrier for writing that first line of code!

The template ships with a new default loading screen and intro screen featuring
the Blipjoy logo. Since this will serve mostly for my own benefit, I decided to
just use my own branding.

Use `#debug` at the end of the URL to skip the intro and enable debug mode.
